## Course Description

Jenkins is a powerful automation platform, but unlocking its full potential requires more than basic job configuration. In this course, you’ll build on foundational Jenkins knowledge to design scalable, maintainable, and secure CI/CD workflows.

You’ll work with pipelines as code, integrate Jenkins with version control systems, distribute builds using agents and Docker, manage artifacts and test results, and secure Jenkins using user accounts, permissions, and credentials. Along the way, hands-on challenges reinforce best practices for real-world Jenkins environments.

By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped to manage Jenkins pipelines at scale and confidently support modern CI/CD workflows in production environments.

## Course Structure

This repository is organized into directories that correspond to the videos, labs, and challenges in the course. Each chapter has its own directory, and within each chapter directory are subdirectories for each lesson, challenge, or solution.

The course is organized into the following chapters:

| Chapter | Description |
| ------ | ------------ |
| **0: Introduction** | From code to production with Jenkins and deploying a Jenkins server |
| **1: Pipelines** | Creating pipelines, using build steps, variables, parameters, conditional logic, and a hands-on pipeline challenge |
| **2: Version Control Systems** | Pipeline as code with Jenkinsfiles, connecting Jenkins to GitHub, running scripts, and a GitHub integration challenge |
| **3: Distributed Builds** | Scaling builds with agents, configuring SSH agents, Docker-based agents, and improving a Docker agent pipeline |
| **4: Artifacts and Testing** | Fingerprinting artifacts, publishing reports, using test results to control pipelines, and analyzing errors with AI |
| **5: Securing Jenkins** | User accounts, project-based permissions, secrets and credentials, and securing Jenkins with role-based access |
| **6: Conclusion** | Next steps and where to go after the course |

## Installing

To use these exercise files, you should have the following installed:

* **OpenJDK**, a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform
* **Git**, a distributed version control system
* **Jenkins**, an open-source automation server
* **Docker**, for lessons involving Docker-based agents

Installation and configuration are covered in the course, with additional guidance provided in the exercise files where needed.

To get started:

* Clone this repository to your local machine using your system’s terminal or a GUI tool such as SourceTree or GitHub Desktop
