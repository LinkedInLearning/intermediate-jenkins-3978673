# 03_04 Challenge: Improve a Docker Agent Pipeline

In this challenge, you’ll configure Jenkins to run pipeline jobs using a **Docker-based agent**. You’ll confirm Docker is available on the Jenkins server, configure Jenkins to communicate with Docker using the Docker Plugin, and then improve an existing pipeline so it takes full advantage of Docker agents, stages, and steps.

This challenge reinforces how Jenkins dynamically provisions build environments using Docker containers and how pipelines define their execution environment as code.

## Challenge Tasks

To complete this challenge, you will:

* Confirm Docker is installed and accessible on the Jenkins server
* Install and configure the Docker Plugin
* Create a Docker Cloud on the Jenkins controller
* Run a pipeline that uses a Docker agent
* Improve the pipeline by organizing it into clear stages and steps

This challenge should take 10-15 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* Admin access to a running Jenkins server
* Terminal access to the server where Jenkins is running
