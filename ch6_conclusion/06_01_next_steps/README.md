# 06_01 Next Steps

Thanks for joining me for this course on Intermediate Jenkins.

By now, you’ve explored some of the more powerful and flexible capabilities Jenkins offers—from securing your server and configuring permissions to working with distributed agents, Docker-based builds, and more advanced pipeline patterns.

This course is part of a broader Jenkins learning path, and if you haven’t already completed the other courses, I strongly encourage you to check them out:

[Learning Path: Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) with Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/continuous-integration-continuous-delivery-ci-cd-with-jenkins)

* [**Learning Jenkins: Automating Software Development and System Administration**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-jenkins-automating-software-development-and-system-administration?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A65318fe0498e39ae9994a9dc): A foundational course that introduces Jenkins concepts, terminology, and everyday workflows.

* [**Running Jenkins on AWS: Deploying and Managing Jenkins on Cloud Infrastructure**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/running-jenkins-on-aws-deploying-and-managing-jenkins-on-cloud-infrastructure?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A65318fe0498e39ae9994a9dc): A practical course focused on running Jenkins in the cloud, managing infrastructure, and operating Jenkins in production environments.

Taken together, these courses are designed to help you grow from understanding Jenkins basics to confidently operating and extending Jenkins in real-world CI/CD environments.

As you wrap up this course, I encourage you to apply what you’ve learned to your own projects—experiment with different agent configurations, refine your pipelines, and continue improving your automation practices.

And if you found this course helpful, I’d love to hear about it. Feel free to share your experience on LinkedIn and let others know how you’re using Jenkins in your workflows.

Continuously,
